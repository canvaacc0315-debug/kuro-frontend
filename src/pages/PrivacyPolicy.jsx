      <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how RovexAI
        collects, uses, and protects information when you use our website and
        services.

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>
        RovexAI does not collect personal information unless it is required to
        provide our services. Account authentication and user management are
        handled securely by trusted third‑party providers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may collect limited usage data to improve performance, reliability,
        and user experience. Uploaded documents are processed only to provide
        AI‑powered features and are not shared with third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>Advertising & Cookies</h2>

      <p>
        RovexAI uses Google AdSense to display advertisements. Google may use
        cookies or similar technologies to personalize ads based on your visits
        to this and other websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Google’s Ads
        Settings. RovexAI does not control how third‑party advertisers use data.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

      <p>
        Information collected is used solely to operate, maintain, and improve
        our services. We do not sell, rent, or trade user data to third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>

      <p>
        We use industry‑standard security measures to protect user data.
        Authentication is handled securely by third‑party services, and all
        communications are encrypted wherever possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>

      <p>
        RovexAI may contain links to third‑party websites or services. We are not
        responsible for the privacy practices or content of those external
        services.
